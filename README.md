# Volumetric scans on my vocal tract
Scans of my vocal tract from July 2011, in the public domain 

One of the weaknesses of my [dissertation research](https://web.archive.org/web/20100329003501/http://apil.arizona.edu/baker/) was that it was based on data from a cadaver, so it is difficult to relate the output of the model to the speech of a living person. On July 7, 2011, I spent some time supine in an MRI machine and got a lot of scans of my vocal tract. This is volumetric data, at very good resolution: the pixels of the images are 1.1875 mm square, and the images are spaced 1.2 mm apart. Each scan required about 20 seconds to acquire. I stabilized my vocal tract by phonating throughout the acquisition; I used creaky voice to make my breath last longer. The images were acquired in Edinburgh, while I was at Queen Margaret University working on this with [Jim Scobbie](https://www.qmu.ac.uk/schools-and-divisions/shs/shs-staff/professor-james-m-scobbie/). The [British Academy](http://www.britac.ac.uk/) generously provided funding.

I have released the images into the public domain with the CC0 1.0 Universal license. You may credit me (Adam Baker) if you wish, but there's no legal need.

For the sociolinguists: I am a native speaker of American English. I grew up in southern California and Arizona. When prompted on forms I tick the “white” box for race/ethnicity. I was 28 years old at the time of the scans.

The files below are compressed in [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) compression format. The images are in [DICOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicom) image format. The standard image processing software isn't going to help you. You can view them with something like [MicroDicom](http://www.microdicom.com/). Each of the compressed files below also has a [MetaImage](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/MetaIO/Documentation) file, which a lot of medical-imaging-type programs can read.

If 3D data in DICOM format is a bit intense, I've also identified the sagittal slices and put them in a zip file [here](Sagittal-Slices.zip) (~2 MB). They're in PNG format (which your computer will read easily), each having a file name like ɑ.png, ɪ.png, ʊ.png, etc. in order to identify the segment. These could be a nice teaching resource.
